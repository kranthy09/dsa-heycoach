# Two Dimensinal arrays

2D Arrays can increase in size along length and width, are also known as matrix. Dimension of the matrix is defined as rows x cols. Number of rows is size of the array and Number of columns is size of array at at index i(0).

Computer stores 2d dimensional arrays by Vector<int>(Vector<int>) which is nothing but array of arrays.

- rows = arr.size()
- cols = arr[0].size()

rows and cols define the dimension of a 2d array : rows x cols

### Printing Diagonal Elements of matrix

```
matrix = [
    [3, 1, 4, 2],
    [4, 5, 6, 0],
    [2, 3, 5, 6],
    [1,2, 9, 8]
]
```

```c
// dexter diagonal
for (i=o t0 rows-1){
    printf(arr[i][i])
}

// Sinister diagonal
for (i=0 to rows-1){
    printf(arr[i][n-1-i])
}
```

## Question

<b>Spiral Matrix</b>
Given an array, print the elements in spiral form.
mat = [ [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], [12, 13, 14, 5 ], [11, 16, 15, 6 ], [10, 9, 8, 7 ] ]

```c
// Traversal Order:
  1 →  2 →  3 →  4
↑ 12   13 → 14   5 ↓
↑ 11 ↑ 16   15 ↓ 6 ↓
  10 ← 9  ← 8  ← 7
```
