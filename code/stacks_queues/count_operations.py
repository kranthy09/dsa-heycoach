"""
Given a string S consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets
 '{' and '}', find out the minimum number of operations required
 to convert the string into a balanced expression.

A single operation means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.

Return the minimum number of reversals required to balance the
bracket sequence. If balancing is not possible, return -1.
