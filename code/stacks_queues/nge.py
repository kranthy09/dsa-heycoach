"""
Given an array of integers, determine the next greater element (NGE),
for every element in the array maintaing the order of appearance

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and
 for 4, since it doesn't exist, it is -1.

Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]
Output: [8, -1, 1, 3, -1]
Explanation: The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there
is no larger elements hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1 ,
for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on right and hence -1.
